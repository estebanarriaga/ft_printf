-fsanitize-memory-track-origins=<value>:

    This flag enables origins tracking in MemorySanitizer.
    The <value> can be one of the following:
        0 or never: Disables origins tracking.
        1 or always: Enables origins tracking for all loads.
        2 or error: Enables origins tracking for loads that cause errors.
    Origins tracking helps identify the source of uninitialized memory reads and can provide more detailed information about the location in the code where the issue occurred.
	
-fsanitize-memory-track-origins:

    This flag is equivalent to -fsanitize-memory-track-origins=always, which enables origins tracking for all loads.
    It's a shorter way to enable origins tracking without specifying the <value>.

-fsanitize-memory-use-after-dtor:

    This flag enables use-after-destroy detection in MemorySanitizer.
    Use-after-destroy refers to accessing memory that has already been destroyed or deallocated. MSan can detect such issues, helping to prevent undefined behavior.
